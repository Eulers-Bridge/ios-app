It's Good to Be White...

Listen up, fellow white people. Buzz knows that the election of a black president has ushered in a giddy era for many of us. White people have been able to get away with stuff we wouldn't have dared in pre-Obama days: that whole birther thing, the secret Muslim crap, accusing Obama of running a "gangster government" — hell, the very existence of Michele Bachmann. A few years ago all that might have made us look bad. Now we simply shrug and point to the White House. How can racism be an issue in American politics? we white folks say. Look who's president!
