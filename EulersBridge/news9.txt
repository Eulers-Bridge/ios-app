SSA Fee Increase

In October 2011, the Australian Parliament passed legislation to allow Universities and other higher education providers, to charge a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) from 2012.

The Student Services and Amenities Fee provides a significant increase in the level of funding available to student services and amenities at tertiary institutions. It means an increased quality and quantity of the services available to you at this University.

The amount you are charged will depend on whether you are considered to be a full-time or part-time student in the 2014 academic year. You are considered to be enrolled part-time if you have an overall study load for 2014 of less than 75% of the normal full-time study load. If your enrolment changes during the year, and your total enrolment load changes from part-time to full-time or from full-time to part-time, your SSAF charge will be recalculated accordingly.
